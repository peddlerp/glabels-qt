I have been using GLabels for years on Linuxmint 18.x. I recently upgraded to 20.3, another laptop is 19. I have installed Glabels 3.4.1 on both. My old files which include barcodes are no longer compatible. Th barcodes are too large and are not size adjustable
I have attempted to create new files, the barcodes have the same issues.
Thanks for any help, advice.
